Code covers all the required cases.
- Milestone 1:  The ZooKeeper service is deployed and is accessible by the applications. 
                The adapter logic has been written to go between the existing centralized 
                Discovery and Kazoo client, and ability of this composite to communicate 
                with ZooKeeper. Registration and de-registration of publisher/subscribers 
                works with the single instance of centralized discovery.
- Milestone 2:  Brokers run a leader election when they first join and in the event of any 
                broker failure. All watch mechanisms work as specified, including informing 
                publishers/subscribers of which node is the current primary broker. The 
                viaBroker strategy now works using the primary broker as elected using ZooKeeper.
- Milestone 3:  Both graceful and unexpected termination of publishers and subscribers are handled.
                Subscribers/publishers can come and go at any time.
