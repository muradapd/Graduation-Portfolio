Code covers all the required cases.
- Milestone 1:  Developed the logic for the Subscriber and Discovery applications (including middleware).
                Both publishers and subscribers are able to register with the Discovery service. The 
                Discovery service replies with a “true” once the system is ready.
- Milestone 2:  Publishers are able to disseminate using the direct approach; subscribers are able to 
                receive from every publisher who publishes topics they are interested in. Code is testable 
                in mininet using the run_mininet_test.py file.
- Milestone 3:  The system is configurable to use either of the dissemination strategies system wide. 
                Works with multiple publishers publishing multiple different publications and multiple 
                subscribers, all of them distributed over different hosts.
