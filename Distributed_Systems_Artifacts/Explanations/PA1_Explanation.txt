Code covers all the required cases.
- Milestone 1:  Both publishers and subscribers are able to register with the Discovery service. 
                The Discovery service replies with a “true” once the system is ready. Publishers 
                are able to disseminate; subscribers are able to receive from every publisher who 
                publishes topics they are interested in. The system is configurable to use either 
                of the dissemination strategies system wide. Works with multiple publishers 
                publishing multiple different publications and multiple subscribers, all of them 
                distributed over different hosts. This can all be tested by using the 
                'PA1.3/run_mininet_test.py' file.
